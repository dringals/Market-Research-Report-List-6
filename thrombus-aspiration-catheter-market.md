<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thrombus Aspiration Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Type</li><li>Lumen Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thrombus aspiration catheter market comprises two main types: hydrophilic and lumen types. Hydrophilic thrombus aspiration catheters feature a surface that becomes slippery when exposed to moisture, enhancing maneuverability within blood vessels and improving thrombus removal efficiency. In contrast, lumen-type catheters are designed with a specific internal passage to facilitate effective suction of clots while minimizing the risk of vessel damage. Both types cater to varying clinical needs in managing thromboembolic conditions, contributing to improved patient outcomes.</p></p>
