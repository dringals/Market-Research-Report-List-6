<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Thermometers for Clinical Usage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared thermometers for clinical usage are categorized into two main types: non-contact and contact types. Non-contact infrared thermometers measure body temperature from a distance, providing quick and convenient readings without physically touching the patient, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination. In contrast, contact thermometers require placement against the skin or in body orifices for accurate readings. While contact types typically offer more precise measurements, non-contact types are favored in fast-paced clinical settings for their ease of use and patient comfort.</p></p>
