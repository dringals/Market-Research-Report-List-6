<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The C-MET / HGF Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>C-Met Biologic Inhibitors</li><li>Small Molecule C-Met Inhibitors</li><li>HGF Antagonist Antibodies</li><li>C-Met Antagonist Antibodies(MetMAb)</li><li>HGF Kringle Variant Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The C-MET/HGF inhibitors market comprises various types targeting the C-MET pathway, crucial in cancer progression. C-MET biologic inhibitors include monoclonal antibodies that disrupt C-MET signaling. Small molecule C-MET inhibitors are chemically synthesized to block C-MET activity directly. HGF antagonist antibodies neutralize Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) to prevent tumor growth. C-MET antagonist antibodies, like MetMAb, specifically target and inhibit C-MET. HGF kringle variant antagonists are designed to inhibit the action of HGF, preventing its interaction with C-MET, thus hindering tumor development.</p></p>
