<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lactose-Free Infant Formula Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Milk Infant Formula</li><li>Non-milk Infant Formula</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lactose-free infant formula market primarily consists of two types: milk infant formula and non-milk infant formula. Milk infant formula is derived from cow's milk but has been processed to remove lactose, making it suitable for lactose-intolerant infants while still providing essential nutrients. Non-milk infant formula, on the other hand, is plant-based or formulated without any dairy ingredients, often using soy, rice, or other sources, catering to infants with dairy allergies or those on specialized diets. Both types support healthy infant development while addressing dietary sensitivities.</p></p>
