<p><h1>Drug-Eluting Balloons Market, Centers on Aspects such as Market Growth Market Share, Market Opportunity, and Projected Forecasts Spanning from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Drug-Eluting Balloons Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) are innovative medical devices used primarily in interventional cardiology and peripheral vascular interventions. These balloons are coated with therapeutic drugs that are released during angioplasty procedures, aimed at preventing restenosis – the narrowing of blood vessels after they have been treated. DEBs offer a localized delivery of medication, providing an effective alternative to stents while reducing the risks associated with implantation.</p><p>The Drug-Eluting Balloons Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.4% during the forecast period, driven by increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, a rising aging population, and advancements in balloon technology. The growing preference for minimally invasive procedures also fuels market expansion, as DEBs allow for less trauma and quicker recovery times compared to traditional methods. Recent trends indicate a focus on the development of novel drugs to enhance therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. Moreover, regulatory approvals for innovative DEBs are encouraging market players to invest in research and development, fostering competitive dynamics. The integration of digital technologies in healthcare further supports the adoption of DEBs, as it enables better patient monitoring and data collection, enhancing overall treatment outcomes.</p></p>
