<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive tire market primarily consists of two main types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires feature cord plies positioned at a diagonal angle to the tread, offering a flexible sidewall and better grip in off-road conditions, but they can wear out more quickly. Radial tires, on the other hand, have plies that run perpendicular to the tread, providing improved fuel efficiency, stability, and longevity, making them the preferred choice for most modern vehicles due to their superior performance on highways.</p></p>
